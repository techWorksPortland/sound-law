As your attorney, he has experience working in multiple jurisdictions as public defenders and private counsel at the trial and appellate levels. We find that our diverse backgrounds allows us to connect with our clients at a very fundamental level. Criminal defense is by nature, a very human endeavor.

            </div>
            <div class="timeline-body"><p class="text-muted">One of the problems with the criminal “justice” system is access to justice. For those who are legally indigent, a public defender is automatically appointed. For those who are slightly above the federal poverty line, they go bankrupt spending thousands of dollars on expensive representation. Those who are rich can hire the “best”.<br><br>To be clear, many public defenders are stellar lawyers. We have had the pleasure of working with many incredibly talented public defenders in Washington state. However, it is true that public defenders have insane caseloads and simply cannot devote the requisite time to each and every case. We know, we’ve been there.<br><br>That is why we have developed our own unique philosophy and approach to criminal defense: we like to consider ourselves lawyers for the “middle class”. We will give you the big firm treatment, but for a middle-class price.</p></div>

We do not believe in frivolous expenditures, like a high-rise office or thousand-dollar Italian suits. After all, the client ends up bearing those costs.

            </div>
            <div class="timeline-body"><p class="text-muted">The saying “you can catch more bees with honey than vinegar” is something that many lawyers do not understand. The truth is, being the stereotypical uncompromising, combative defense lawyer often times backfires. And who suffers from that? The client. We have cordial, professional working relationships with our adversaries. Of course there are situations that necessitate a more aggressive approach. But, our experience has shown that better results are achieved by simply being courteous, agreeable, and respectful with our adversaries and judges.<br><br>Many lawyers will often tout their experience in claiming they are great at what they do. But, this is a logical fallacy: just because you have been doing something for a long time, that does not necessarily mean you’re good at it. It’s particularly laughable when a lawyer calls him or herself “the best”. What exactly is unit of measure? Because you say so? Although we bring over 20 years in combined experience to the table, we are worth our salt not because of our time served, but because of the results we deliver</p></div>

        </div>
        <p>Ryan was born and raised in the greater Los Angeles area but left when he was 18. Since then, he has lived up and down the west coast and southwest, has attended 6 different colleges, worked numerous jobs, and met some really interesting people in the process. Washington is by far his favorite state, and he now considers himself a Washingtonian. He started working when he was 13 as a math and reading tutor. He then worked throughout high school, whether it was washing cars, mowing lawns, tending a cash register, collecting shopping carts, or soliciting people for blood donations. He also worked through college as a salesman, a music teacher, and then as a car mechanic to pay the bills. Finally, he ended up back in Los Angeles after bouncing around from college to college and graduated with a degree in philosophy with a pre-law minor. Ryan's passion is working on cars (especially classics), and he has continued to do that until enrolling in law school. Ryan has had a variety of unusual and unique experiences throughout life that have helped him connect with his clients.
        <br><br>
        Ryan's father and step-father were both cops, so naturally he became a defense lawyer. Throughout law school, Ryan worked, first for a superior court judge, criminal trial attorney, then a firm doing criminal appeals, and then the Department of Public Defense in King County. Due to the circumstances his employer created, he worked on multiple criminal appeals involving serious felony convictions with scarce or no supervision. From that, he learned the intricacies of criminal, appellate defense. Ryan was fortunate enough to have a fantastic supervisor and mentor at the Associated Counsel for the Accused – one of the best trial lawyers in Washington state. During the last year of law school, I learned how to be a courtroom lawyer and took my first case to trial. After five days, it resulted with the jury delivering two guilty verdicts (but after four hours of deliberation, so he made them think). But, because he already understood the appeals system, he told his client that she should appeal because the trial judge made a reversible error, which Ryan objected to at this trial. Essentially, the judge didn’t let him argue his theory of the case and excluded highly relevant evidence. The higher court agreed, reversed, and charges were dismissed.
        <br><br>
        The first case Ryan took to trial as a licensed attorney, he won outright with a 30 minute not guilty verdict on two counts that were originally filed as felonies. Ryan boasts a stellar trial record with proven results. Although his style of lawyering is polite and respectful when it comes to negotiating, he is not afraid of trial and welcomes it any day. No matter what your charge is, whether it be a simple speeding ticket, DUI, or serious felony, Ryan knows how to approach it.
        <br><br>
        In his spare time, Ryan enjoys working on his classic cars, exploring the Pacific Northwest, and experiencing fine arts.

                      <p>No matter how serious the charges – from disorderly conduct to assault in the first degree – we understand that it’s your life. We will tirelessly work to get you the best result possible. Every case is different and as such, requires its own unique approach. We will explore every possible avenue available and leave no stone unturned. Our trial tactics and diplomacy have created a track record of very satisfied clients.</p>
                      <p>Every crime has a list of “elements”, that is, a checklist of items that the government must possess in order to convict you. Often times, circumstances and facts are present or absent that negate a critical element of the crime charged. That is the role of the criminal defense attorney: to alert the prosecution that they either have a weak case, or no case at all.</p>
                      <p>A vast majority of cases are resolved by what we all know as a “plea deal”. Negotiations are premised on what the parties can expect to happen at trial. Trial is always a risky endeavor – no one ever truly knows what the jury is thinking. Plea deals can be seen as a compromise, and shouldn’t necessarily be viewed in a negative light. Although we always welcome taking a case to trial, we cannot make the decision for you. We will lay out all of your options for you and explain the ramifications of each and guide you in making an informed decision.</p>
                      <p>Because every case is different, there is no way for us to adequately explain the ins and outs of every situation with a “one size fits all” approach. We tailor your defense to your own special needs. That is why we encourage you to call us at anytime for a 100% free, confidential consultation.</p>

                        If you’ve been drinking, be prepared for this question to come up immediately: so how much have you had to drink tonight? It’s not advisable to lie. It’s also not advisable to tell the truth. Simply say: officer, I don’t feel comfortable answering your questions. You do, however, have to provide your license, registration, and proof of insurance.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Do not crack your window one inch to pass your paperwork to the cop. This will just make the cop mad and raise his or her suspicions.
                      </p>

                        <b>2. Please step out of the vehicle.

                      <p>
                        You must comply. If not, you could be charged with obstruction of justice. Generating Probable Cause to Make an Arrest
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>3. Would you like to take some voluntary field sobriety tests?</b>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The answer is always unequivocally NO! There are three main field sobriety tests (FSTs) the cop will try to administer. You must be advised that they are voluntary, because the law says so. These tests are designed to generate probable cause to arrest you.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Horizonal Gaze Nystagmus: This test measures ow much your eyes twitch (nystagmus) when following a stimulus (usually a pen). This test is usually a dead giveaway if you’ve been drinking. Don’t do it.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Walk and Turn: This test will have you take 9 steps in an imaginary straight line, pivot on one foot, and walk back. The rationale is if you’re drunk, your balance will be off. Again, don’t do it.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        One Leg Stand: This test requires you to balance on one foot with your other foot’s big toe pointing straight up. Many people can’t even do this sober.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Portable Breath Test (PBT): This test is voluntary and the result cannot be used to prosecute you. It is only used to generate probable cause to arrest. There is much debate on whether to take this test. Many lawyers will unequivocally say never take any voluntary tests. HOWEVER, by volunteering to take the portable breath test, you will have an idea of what your BAC level is, and that will be relevant in deciding on whether or not to take the evidential test. (See section 4) The argument against taking the portable breath test is it will give the cop another reason to arrest you. But, bear in mind, even if you don’t take any of the other three FSTs, if you smell like alcohol and the cop thinks you’re drunk, you’re probably going to jail.
                      </p>

                        <b>4. What happens when I’m taken back to the station?</b>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        You will be Mirandized a second time, after being Mirandized on the field. The cop is required to allow you to speak with an attorney if you so desire. We recommend you exercise this option. You will likely be put in contact with an on-call public defender, who hopefully can advise you whether or not to take the breath test. Then, the cop will read you a sheet advising you of the “Implied Consent Warning”. This is an advisement of what consequences will occur if you do not take the breath test back at the station. If you have never been convicted of a DUI before and if you refuse to take the test, your license will automatically be suspended for one year. Additionally, if you refuse to take the test, the cop could apply for a telephonic search warrant to forcibly extract your blood.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        If you take the test and your BAC is above .08, the Department of Licensing will suspend your license for 90 days. The cop will give you a form explaining how to request a “DUI Hearing”. This will give your attorney an opportunity to fight your imminent license suspension.

                      </p>
                      <p>
                        It depends on many factors. Many counties will release you on your personal recognizance (PR release) if you do not have any prior convictions, with your promise to appear in court on a specified date. King, Pierce, Thurston, Snohomish, and Kitsap counties typically will release you after the booking process. More rural counties like Lewis and Cowlitz will require a judge to make this decision. That means if you got arrested on Friday, you’re spending the weekend in jail.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        If you have a prior DUI conviction, more than likely bail will be imposed.

                        <b>6. The DUI Hearing</b>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This is a separate administrative hearing from your case in a criminal court. The law has changed and you now only have 7 days from the date of arrest to request this hearing. These hearings are very difficult to win for a number of reasons. The only 4 issues the DOL will concern itself with are the following:
                      </p>
                      <div class="ml-5">
                        <p>
                          <b>a.</b> Whether or not the DOL has jurisdiction to revoke your license.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          <b>b.</b> Whether or not the officer had reasonable grounds to stop your vehicle.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          <b>c.</b> Whether or not the officer had reasonable grounds to make an arrest.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          <b>d.</b> Whether or not your decision to take the breath test was voluntarily and intelligently made.
                        </p>
                      </div>
                      <p>
                        There are a myriad of arguments to be made with regard to each 4 issues and depend on the individual facts of each case.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        <b>7. I’m out of jail, now what I do?</b>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Now is the time to decide if you want to hire a private attorney or have a public defender represent you. You must be indigent to qualify for a public defender, which means that your yearly income has to be around $15,000 or less. One thing to bear in mind when deciding to go with a public defender is this: the public defender will not help you out with many things that a private attorney can and should. Representation at the DOL hearing, helping you find a treatment agency to get an alcohol assessment, and helping you get your license back are all things that a private defense attorney can help you with. We have dealt with hundreds of DUI cases and know exactly how to accomplish these goals.
                      </p>

                      <p>

                      <p>
                        Again, this will depend on the court, the individual facts of your case, the judge, the prosecutor, etc. But, no matter the court, you can expect the following types of hearings:
                      </p>

                      <div class="ml-5">
                        <p>
                          <b>Arraignment:</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           This is your initial appearance, where a formal plea will be taken. The court will decide what conditions to impose, and tell you when to come back for a pretrial hearing. Standard DUI conditions are the following:
                        </p>

                        <div class="ml-5">
                          <p>
                            <b>a.</b> Law abiding behavior
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            <b>b.</b> No driving without a license or insurance
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            <b>c.</b> No breath test refusal upon a reasonable request by law enforcement
                          </p>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                          The judge can also require you to have an ignition interlock device installed on your vehicle, an alcohol monitoring device put on your ankle (called a “SCRAM”) or both. Again, this depends on the individual facts of the case.
                        </p>


                        <p>
                          <b>Pretrial Hearing:</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The first one is usually continued for additional investigations and negotiations. The purpose of a pretrial hearing is to see if a compromise or plea bargain can be made.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          <b>Readiness Hearing:</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          This is a hearing that is typically set one to two weeks before trial. This is when the parties answer “ready” for trial.

                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Criminal convictions are not necessarily permanent. The reason why our judicial system has multiple layers of appellate review is simple: trial judges can and do make mistakes.</p>
                <div class="container text-left">

                    <div class="">
                      <p>An appeal is not, contrary to popular believe, an opportunity to relitigate a case that went to trial simply because you’re not happy with the outcome. The appellate court will only be reviewing issues of law, that is, errors made by the lawyers or the trial judge. The appellate court will not substitute its own judgment for that of the jury. Importantly, the appellate court will only consider what happened at trial. No new evidence can be introduced. In other words, it is a “closed universe”. Think of an appeal as an opportunity to tell the appellate court why your trial was fundamentally unfair or flawed.</p>
                      <p>A direct appeal is what occurs after a litigant loses at the trial level. It is also called an “appeal as a matter of right” and must be filed within 30 days of entry of final judgment at the trial level. The trial lawyer can easily accomplish this in order to “preserve the appeal”.</p>
                      <p>In Washington, there are three divisions of the Court of Appeals: Seattle (Div. I), Tacoma (Div. II), and Spokane (Div. III). Where your appeal is heard will depend on what county your trial originated in.</p>
                      <p>Appellate courts apply what is called a “standard of review” to the issues raised. There are many types of standards, for example: de novo, abuse of discretion, manifest error etc. Often times, the appellate argument will be won or lost depending on what standard is applied.</p>
                      <p>There are other types of appeals available to criminal defendants. The most common type in Washington is called a Personal Restraint Petition (“PRP”). This is a collateral attack on the conviction, and the Court of Appeals and Supreme Court have concurrent jurisdiction. The most common way to launch a PRP is based on newly discovered evidence. This can be contrasted from a direct appeal, which only focuses on what happened at the trial.</p>
                      <p>The appellate process can be long, expensive, and painful. Often times, the appellant is sitting in prison, waiting for his or her conviction to be overturned. If a conviction gets reversed, that is not the end of the process. It will be kicked back down to the trial court for a “redo”. Very rarely will a case get dismissed on appeal. The most common way for that to happen is for insufficient evidence, and it is extremely rare.</p>
                      <p class="mb-0">It is difficult to adequately inform the client what his or her chances of winning on appeal are until the entire trial record is reviewed. We will never lull you in a false sense of security. But, we will be more than happy to conduct an initial review of your appeal to discuss potential issues and strategies.</p>
                      <div class="text-center my-3">
                        <h3>The Criminal Appeals Process</h3>
                      </div>
                      <h5>1. The Trial</h5>
                      <p>Believe it or not, the appeals process starts at the trial level. As trial lawyers, we always are thinking about issues on appeal when trying a case before a jury. The primary method to preserve an issue for the appellate court’s review is simply to object. That will notify the appellate lawyer to focus his or her attention to that portion of the trial. If the trial lawyer does not object to an objectionable mistake, that may present a different type of appellate issue: ineffective assistance of counsel.<p>
                      <p>After the jury returns a verdict of guilty, the defendant has 30 days to submit a notice of appeal. If not, the appeal is forfeited. Every trial lawyer should be aware of this.</p>
                      <h5>2. Preparing the Appeal</h5>
                      <p>Once the notice of appeal has been filed, the appellate lawyer can formally begin the appellate process. Gathering the trial transcripts is the first step. Because trials can take weeks, sometimes even months, the trial transcripts often are thousands of pages. The transcript fees can be waived if the defendant is legally indigent. The trial transcripts include every word, gesture, and remark made at the trial. Every word must be reviewed by the appellate attorney to ensure thoroughness.</p>
                      <p>Then, the appellate lawyer must collect a separate collection of papers, called the “clerk’s papers”. This includes everything that the lawyers filed at the trial level: trial exhibits, witness statements, motions and the like. After that, the lawyer will then “designate” the clerks papers to the appellate court, which means copying the papers that the appellant wishes to have the appellate court review.</p>
                      <p>It can take a few months for the trial proceedings to be transcribed by the court reporter. Once this is done, the appellate lawyer can begin reviewing the record for appeal.</p>
                      <h5>3. Preparing and Filing the Opening Brief</h5>
                      <p>Every appeal must list “assignments of error”, which is an exhaustive list of legal errors that occurred at the trial. They must direct the appellate court’s attention to where in the trial transcripts the errors occurred. The assignments of error are what the appellate lawyer use to craft the issues on appeal.</p>
                      <p>After reviewing the trial transcripts and clerk’s papers, the appellate lawyer is tasked with legal research. Finding legal authority to support the issues on appeal is where the real action begins. Crafting persuasive, legally cogent and valid, creative arguments is what will ultimately get a conviction reversed. The appellate lawyer is then tasked with filing the appellate brief with the Court of Appeals. This is the first work product that the appellate lawyer produces. It is restricted to 50 pages and can sometimes be requested for a longer page limit depending on the complexity and length of the trial.</p>
                      <p>After the opening appellant’s brief is filed, the State then has 60 days to respond with a “response brief”. Because the appellant is the party to initiate the appeal, the appellant has the chance for the last word by filing a “reply brief”.</p>
                      <h5>4. Oral Argument</h5>
                      <p>The Court of Appeals will decide whether or not an oral argument is warranted. Sometimes the Court will summarily decide the case on the merits without scheduling oral argument. There is debate in the legal community what this means, from the Court’s perspective. If oral argument is scheduled, it is often viewed as a sign that the case can go either way. If the Court already had its mind made up one way or another, it probably would not schedule oral argument.</p>
                      <p>If oral argument is scheduled, the litigants will typically have 10 minutes each to argue their case, with the appellant going first and having the option of reserving a few minutes for rebuttal (again, the appellant gets the last word). This proceeding will be in front of a panel of three judges, who will question the lawyers as to their legal arguments. Often times the judges’ questions can be a forecast of how the Court will rule.</p>
                      <p>No decision will be rendered on the spot. The Court will take the case under advisement and then issue a formal written opinion. This can take anywhere to a month to over a year, depending on the unique features of the case.</p>
                      <h5>5. The Opinion</h5>
                      <p>The Court will then issue its formal decision, which is called an opinion. If the conviction is reversed, it will then be remanded to the trial court for the State to refile the charges. Sometimes, the case won’t be refiled. Again, every case is different and there is no general rule when it comes to a reversed conviction on remand.</p>
                      <p>If the appellant loses, he or she may then file an appeal to the Supreme Court for discretionary review. It is not an appeal as a matter of right; the appellant must request permission from the Supreme Court for further review. This must be done within 30 days of the Court of Appeals’ decision.</p>

            <br><br>At Sound Law, we have experience dealing with a wide range of cases and clients. We take on cases all throughout Western Washington, as far south as Vancouver all the way up to Bellingham. We've taken cases to trial all throughout Washington, overturned convictions on appeal, and fought insurance companies for settlements our clients deserve.  We will always pick up the phone and help you get through whatever legal nightmare you are going through.</p></div>

            </div>
            <div class="timeline-body"><p class="text-muted">One of the problems with the “justice” system is "access" to justice. It doesn't matter how serious or seemingly petty a criminal charge is, or how catastrophic or minor an injury may be. Everyone is entitled to have their rights vindicated by a passionate, zealous advocate. That is what we can offer you at Sound Law.
            <br><br>Access to justice shouldn't depend on your net worth. That is why we have developed our own unique philosophy and approach to criminal defense: we like to consider ourselves lawyers for the people, not the elite. We will give you the big firm treatment, but for a middle class rate. </p></div>

            </div>
            <div class="timeline-body"><p class="text-muted">We believe there should be a middle ground between the two, very opposite choices of being forced to go with a public defender, or going bankrupt after hiring a big law firm: securing excellent representation while not going broke.
            <br><br>At Sound Law, we keep our costs and overhead low. We do not believe in frivolous expenditures, like a high-rise office or thousand-dollar Italian suits. After all, the client ends up bearing those costs. We shift our cost-effective business practices to our clients.</p></div>

            </div>
            <div class="timeline-body"><p class="text-muted">The saying “you can catch more bees with honey than vinegar” is something that many lawyers do not understand. We have professional, respectful working relationships with our adversaries. Of course there are situations that necessitate a more aggressive approach. We do not believe in a "one size fits all" methodology. But, our experience has shown that better results are achieved by simply being courteous, agreeable, and respectful with our adversaries and judges.
            <br><br>Many lawyers will often boast about their years of practice in claiming their superiority. But, this is a logical fallacy: just because you have been doing something for a long time, that doesn't necessarily mean you’re good at it. At Sound Law, our great results are proven with a verifiable track record. </p></div>

        </div>
        <p>Ryan was born and raised in the greater Los Angeles area but left when he was 18. Since then, he has lived up and down the west coast and southwest, has attended 6 different colleges, worked numerous jobs, and met some really interesting people in the process. Washington is by far his favorite state and he now considers himself a Washingtonian. He started working when he was 13 as a math and reading tutor. He then worked throughout high school, whether it was washing cars, mowing lawns, tending a cash register, collecting shopping carts, or soliciting people for blood donations. He also worked through college as a salesman, a music teacher, and then as a car mechanic to pay the bills. Finally, he ended up back in the City of Los Angeles after bouncing around from college to college and graduated with a degree in philosophy with a pre-law minor. Ryan's passion is working on cars (especially classics), and he has continued to do that. Ryan has had a variety of unusual and unique experiences throughout life that have shaped his world view and helped him connect with his clients.
        <br><br>Ryan's father and step-father were both cops, so naturally he became a defense lawyer. Throughout law school, Ryan worked; first for a superior court judge, criminal trial attorney, then a firm doing criminal appeals, and then the Department of Public Defense in King County. Due to the circumstances his employer created, he worked on multiple criminal appeals involving serious felony convictions with scarce or no supervision. From that, he learned the intricacies of criminal, appellate defense. Ryan was fortunate enough to have a fantastic supervisor and mentor at the Associated Counsel for the Accused – a highly regarded trial lawyer in Washington state. During his third year of law school, he learned how to be a courtroom lawyer and took his first case to trial. After five days, it resulted with the jury delivering two guilty verdicts (but after four hours of deliberation, so they really thought about it). But, because he already understood the appellate process, he told his client that she should appeal the conviction because the trial judge committed a reversible error, which Ryan preserved for the appeal. The higher court agreed, reversed, and all charges were dismissed.
        <br><br>The first case Ryan took to trial as a licensed attorney he won outright with a 30 minute not guilty verdict on two counts that were originally filed as felonies. Ryan boasts a stellar trial record with proven results. Although his style of lawyering is polite and respectful when it comes to negotiating, he is not afraid of trial and welcomes it any day. No matter what your case is, whether it be a simple misdemeanor, sex offense, robbery appeal or personal injury claim, Ryan knows how to approach it.

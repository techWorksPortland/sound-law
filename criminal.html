          <h1 class="text-uppercase">Criminal Defense</h1>

            <p>No matter how serious the charges – from disorderly conduct to assault in the first degree – we understand that it’s your life. We will tirelessly work to get you the best result possible. Every case is different and as such, requires its own unique approach. We will explore every possible avenue available and leave no stone unturned. Our trial tactics and diplomacy have created a track record of very satisfied clients.</p>
            <p>Every crime has a list of “elements”, that is, a checklist of items that the government must possess in order to convict you. Often times, circumstances and facts are present or absent that negate a critical element of the crime charged. That is the role of the criminal defense attorney: to alert the prosecution that they either have a weak case, or no case at all.</p>
            <p>A vast majority of cases are resolved by what we all know as a “plea deal”. Negotiations are premised on what the parties can expect to happen at trial. Trial is always a risky endeavor – no one ever truly knows what the jury is thinking. Plea deals can be seen as a compromise, and shouldn’t necessarily be viewed in a negative light. Although we always welcome taking a case to trial, we cannot make the decision for you. We will lay out all of your options for you and explain the ramifications of each and guide you in making an informed decision.</p>
            <p>Because every case is different, there is no way for us to adequately explain the ins and outs of every situation with a “one size fits all” approach. We tailor your defense to your own special needs. That is why we encourage you to call us at anytime for a 100% free, confidential consultation.</p>
